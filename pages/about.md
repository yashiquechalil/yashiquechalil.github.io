I am a Sound Designer and Developer with a background in Electronics Engineering. My goal is to bridge the gap between embedded technology and audio production, fostering a deeper physical connection in how we, as artists and sound designers, create music and sound. By combining the realms of analog, digital, and AI-driven music, I aim to innovate and expand the possibilities within the audio production landscape.
