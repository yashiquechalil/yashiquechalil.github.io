## Stalwarts of Music

As the producer of Stalwarts of Music, I'm thrilled to see how our podcast, hosted by Aditya Veera, has become a vital platform for sharing the incredible musical journeys of Grammy-award-winning virtuosos with audiences in India and beyond. With a dedicated listener base tuning in to our live interviews on Instagram and the radio (Big FM Shillong & Aizawl), Aditya is establishing himself as one of the first Indian music podcasters to focus exclusively on engaging with internationally acclaimed musicians of Western music. His unique interviewing style draws out honest and insightful conversations that deeply resonate with our audience.

In just a year, we've had the privilege of featuring legends like the best-selling instrumental guitarist Joe Satriani, virtuoso guitarist Guthrie Govan, reggae icon Shaggy, American jazz and rock drummer Stewart Copeland, guitar prodigy Julian Lage, American jazz and rock drummer Cindy Blackman Santana, R&B Hall of Fame inductee Phil Perry, four-time Grammy award-winning jazz keyboardist Bob James, the renowned jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour, guitar extraordinaire and songwriter Doyle Bramhall II, the legendary Eric Martin from Mr. Big, and many more.
