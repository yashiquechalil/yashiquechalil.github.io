## An embedded framework for quick prototyping of Programmable Digital Music Instruments (DMIs)

The Hive is a Programmable Digital Music Instrument. The device runs on a Linux-based ARM processor, allowing users to upload and compile a compatible audio processing script in C++ or pure data. It features an interactive control surface that can be programmed and mapped to either parameter controls for audio effects, note inputs for synths or both. This project entails developing audio effects patches using MAX/MSP's extension RNBO, which allows users to export the designed patch as VSTs or C++ scripts.

Testing the plugins that I was developing on a standalone interface is much more engaging. I have carried the interface outdoors into multiple environments to try and process live ambient sounds in different settings and spent hours straight with the interface. This would not have been the case if I had been in the same setting with a laptop. Being able to test my plugin using mostly my ears and without the disctraction of a screen or any visual feedback allowed me to make more meaningful and functional descisions with the developement.
