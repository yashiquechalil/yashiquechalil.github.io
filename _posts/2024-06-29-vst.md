## Micro Delay VST

A delay plugin that breaks the input signal into multiple buffers with variable sizes and interlinked filters. This arrangement takes in the input signal and breaks it up into almost granular layers and produces highly complex and rhytmical textures. This plugin was inspired by the <a href="https://www.hologramelectronics.com/microcosm">Microcosm</a> developed by Hologram. 

I use this plugin extensively to design textural ambient peices for short films and other live performances. 

Here are some short demo's generated using the plugin.
